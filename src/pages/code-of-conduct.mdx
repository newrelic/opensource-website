We believe in the power of Open Source to bring together developers and ideas to solve tricky problems and create the innovative software the world needs.

We respect all people in our community, regardless of their background or the extent of their contributions, and encourage participation from diverse sources. This Code of Conduct documents the principles we encourage in, and expect of, the Open Source community.

- **Be friendly and patient.**
- **Be welcoming.** We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to, members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour, immigration status, social or economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.
- **Be considerate.** Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions. Remember that we’re a world-wide community, so you might not be communicating in someone else’s primary language.
- **Be respectful.** Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior or poor manners. We all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It’s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Members of the New Relic community should be respectful to everyone.
- **Be careful in the words that you choose.** We are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behaviors aren't acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:

  - Violent threats or language directed against another person
  - Discriminatory jokes and language
  - Posting sexualized language or imagery
  - Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information (“doxing”)
  - Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms
  - Unwelcome sexual attention
  - Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior
  - Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.

- **When we disagree, try to understand why.** Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time and New Relic is no exception. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we’re all different. The strength of New Relic comes from its varied community of people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.

This isn’t an exhaustive list of things that you can’t do. Rather, take it in the spirit in which it’s intended - guidelines to make it easier to enrich all of us and the technical communities in which we participate.

The spirit of this Code of Conduct applies equally to everyone in all the spaces where the New Relic Open Source community interacts in the pursuit of creating software. This includes New Relic-managed Slack, mailing lists, Github Issues, and any other forums which the New Relic Open Source community uses for communication.

Our Open Source communities agree to abide by New Relic’s [Acceptable Use Policy](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/licenses/license-information/general-usage-licenses/acceptable-use-policy).

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you report it by emailing us at [opensource@newrelic.com](mailto:opensource@newrelic.com). For more details please see our [Reporting Guidelines](/code-of-conduct-reporting).
