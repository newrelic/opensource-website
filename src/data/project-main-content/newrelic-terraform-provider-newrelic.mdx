The New Relic Terraform Provider integrates with core Terraform to streamline the provisioning and management of resources in your New Relic account.

Codify your New Relic resources using HashiCorp's configuration language (HCL), manage your resources within your CI/CD pipelines, and create an ecosystem of observability best practices.

The New Relic Terraform Provider is one of many tools provided by the [Developer Toolkit](https://newrelic.github.io/developer-toolkit/).

## Getting Started

For more information on how to use the provider to configure your alerts, notifications, monitors, and many other New Relic resources, please view the [documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/newrelic/newrelic/latest/docs).

Go to the project's [README](https://github.com/newrelic/terraform-provider-newrelic#readme) for setup and usage details.


THIS IS A TEST!
