## How New Relic is Involved

New Relic is a [Silver Sponsor](https://adoptopenjdk.net/sponsors.html) of [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net) and participates in technical work related to the project, including:

* Performance Regression testing
* Java Flight Recorder (JFR) and Java Mission Control (JMC)
* Beta testing
* Build tooling

We also use Adopt's binaries extensively in our own JVM-based services and recommend them as the preferred upgrade path from Oracle's binaries.
