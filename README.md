# opensource-website

The `opensource-website` project is the code and data behind [opensource.newrelic.com](https://opensource.newrelic.com) generated by [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org).

![CI](https://github.com/newrelic/opensource-website/workflows/CI/badge.svg) ![GitHub release (latest SemVer including pre-releases)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/newrelic/opensource-website?include_prereleases&sort=semver) [![Snyk](https://snyk.io/test/github/newrelic/opensource-website/badge.svg)](https://snyk.io/test/github/newrelic/opensource-website)

## About

This project is made up of a few components:

- React code, components, and page templates built primarily in [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/)
- Static [data](https://github.com/newrelic/opensource-website/tree/master/src/data) for each open source project listed and promoted on the site, including:
  - `project metadata` in the data/projects directory
  - `project stats` in the data/project-stats directory
  - `markdown content` in the data/project-main-content directory
- Static pages that promote New Relic's engagement in open standards and highlight specific features and collections in New Relic's open source capabilities.
- Automation to handle:
  - updating dynamic data in the `project stats` and `project metadata` directories
  - building the static pages
  - deploying the site to a static hosting platform

### Architecture

### Build and Deploy

This project utilizes Amplify for the hosting environment, and we've decided to employ a modified GitFlow workflow for branch management. This allows us to drive our staging and production sites from branches.

How this works:

- `develop` is the default branch and represents the staging site. Commits (either from PR or directly to the branch) will trigger a deploy to the staging website.
  - One the site is somewhat "stable", ideally all new work will take place in `feature/...` and `fix/...` branches, which are PR'ed to the `develop` branch.
- `master` is our stable production branch and represents the production site. Commits must be initiated via PR's from `develop` -> `master`, and the strategy should be to `rebase and merge` for a cleaner view into the production history (and it will be easier to tell what's in `develop` vs `master`). This will trigger a deploy to the production website.

Our GitHub Actions automation will pick up commits to these branches and act accordingly to build and deploy the site.

In summary, `feature/fix` -> `develop` -> `master` eventually becomes the flow, and automation (via Actions) handles build/deploy behind the scenes.

> Final Note: PRs that are opened from a branch in this repo (not forks) will generate preview links on Amplify automatically.

## Contributing project data

The process to contribute new data or update existing data to `opensource.newrelic.com` is the same.

1. `Fork` this repository.
2. Add/update the two project metadata files (described below) to your forked `opensource-website` repository.
3. Submit a `Pull Request` back to this project containing your new or updated files.
4. If/when your `PR` is accepted, the automation in this project will populate a related file in the `src/data/project-stats` directory, build the site, and deploy a new version of the code (including your project's new data) to `opensource.newrelic.com`.

To add your project to `opensource.newrelic.com`, you must include **the following two metadata files**. To accept and merge a PR, we check that these files are present, and if you're submitting an update, that at least one of these files has been changed.

### 1. Project metadata (JSON)

The JSON file contains the base information about the project detail pages, as well as the project search/exploration page.

**File format:** `src/data/projects/[GITHUB_ORG_NAME]-[GITHUB_REPO_NAME].json`

**Example:** `src/data/projects/newrelic-nr1-github.json`

**Template:** `examples/projects.json`

### 2. Project metadata (MDX)

This MDX file contains the markdown and optional React components that populate the left-hand column of a project detail page.

**File format:** `src/data/project-main-content/[GITHUB_ORG_NAME]-[GITHUB_REPO_NAME].mdx`

**Example:** `src/data/project-main-content/newrelic-nr1-github.mdx`

**Template:** `examples/project-main-content.mdx`
